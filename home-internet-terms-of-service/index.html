            <ul>
                <li>The Shikki Design Home Internet price plans offer uncapped data with tiered download speeds and a Fair Use Policy (FUP) based on the price plan selected.</li>
                <li>Once the Shikki Design Home Internet price plan reaches the defined data download limit as per the Fair Use Policy (FUP), the download speed will be limited to the corresponding rate-limited speed, which will remain effective until the next provisioning cycle. Rate-limited speeds will be specific as per the selected price plan.</li>
                <li>Connectivity to either the 4G or the 5G network is dependent on the type of device used, as well as the type of network coverage available at the Customer’s physical address provided during the coverage and capacity check, and the maximum download speed(s) associated with the plan will remain as contracted whether the customer connects to either the 4G or the 5G network.</li>
                <li>The availability of the Shikki Design Home Internet service will depend on Shikki Design’s network coverage and availability at the Customer’s physical address. Shikki Design does not guarantee network coverage and availability at the Customer’s address.</li>
                <li>The Customer will be required to provide proof of identity, and additional personal information and/or documentation for verification purposes as required by Shikki Design.</li>
                <li>On a month-to-month contract, Shikki Design will provide the device for the price plan selected, which will remain Shikki Design’s property. On a variable length contract (24 months), Shikki Design will provide the device for the price plan selected, and it will become the property of the Customer once the Customer has successfully fulfilled the contract term.</li>
